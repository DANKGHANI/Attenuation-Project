# Attenuation-Project


Objective
Attenuation Relations between Iran and Sharjah horizontal peak ground acceleration

Data Description
Dataset consist of 130 earthquakes and 31 variables for the BHRC (Iran) dataset and for the
UOSS (Sharjah) dataset there are 130 earthquakes and 25 variable, after removing all the
earthquake without time series we finally get 89 earthquake records, These dataset consist
details of the earthquake i.e. earthquake number, station name, Un.PGA, time series, longitude,
latitude, magnitude type, epicentral distance, depth and effective duration, vs30 (m/s) and fault
type etc.  Finally we Apply input from Iran data to 10 developed attenuation equations from
literature and compare the output.

Dependent Variable
Peak ground acceleration, Horizontal peak ground acceleration

Independent Variable
earthquake number, station name, Un.PGA, time series, longitude, latitude, magnitude type,
epicentral distance, depth and effective duration, vs30 (m/s) and fault type etc.

Proposed model
Ensemble methods is a machine learning technique that combines several base models in order
to produce one optimal predictive model. We will design and implement a cutting edge
advanced statistical model using random forest algorithm and get the output for the same
technique after that, we use another technique to build a new model using KNN and the third
model is build using logistic regression. Then we will compare the result of all these algorithm,
finally we will build a new model by combining all these three techniques together (Ensemble
Technique), so that we can get a more accurate model for our research work.
